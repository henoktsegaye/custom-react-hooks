# custom-react-hooks

This is a registery for custom hooks for different libaries or frameworks. 

non-library specific hooks are listed in the root directory `/hooks` while hooks specific to library are listed inside that library ( while the hook might depend on more than one libarary - we took the dominant one and put it under there)
